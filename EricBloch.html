    <p>
    I am a detail-oriented software engineering professional with broad experience
    in Internet technologies, web applications, email systems, electronic-discovery, digital media, computer graphics, 
    user interfaces, anti-malware/security, open-source software, parallel, multi-threaded programming, and distributed
    multi-user computing environments. I like building stuff.  I have hired, managed,
    directed, and mentored software engineers through all phases of
    software development. I have an attention to detail, a strong desire to
    build software that makes people say, 'Wow!', and a passion for shipping
    products and getting shit done.
    </p>
    <p>
    After several years of developer advocacy and community work, I'd like to return to a role in product development proper.
